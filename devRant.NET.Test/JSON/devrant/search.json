The Developer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The Geologist persists and explains that the game is real easy and a lotta fun. He explains, \"I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $5.\" Again, the Developer politely declines and tries to get to sleep.

The Geologist asks the first question. \"What's the distance from the Earth to the moon?\"\n\nThe Developer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the Geologist.\n\nNow, it's the developer's turn. He asks the Geologist, \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?\" The Geologist looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to no avail.\n\nAfter about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. The developer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep.\n\nThe Geologist is more than a little miffed, shakes the developer and asks, \"Well, so what's the answer?\"\n\nWithout a word, the developer reaches into his wallet, hands the Geologist $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.","score":57,"created_time":1496094622,"attached_image":"","num_comments":5,"tags":["dev","devjokes","developer"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"user_id":247644,"user_username":"python-dev","user_score":822,"user_avatar":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-17_c-3_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-2_16-6_3-2_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-2_6-97_10-1_2-39_15-47_18-1_4-1.jpg"}},{"id":605598,"text":"The day I deployed my first application on Play Store.

(I have another one coming, but this one is fresh)\n\nAs a PHP developer (yeah I am and I like it, if you gonna hate on me... go fuck yourself) I expect to not be required to reinvent the wheel when I have to use something that is not too mainstream (in my case was producing JSON and XML HAL responses). Now there are 2 (fairly active and somewhat mature), one of which does not produce XML responses, so off I went with the other one, but for fucks sake it does not produce XML that is compliant with the (draft)RFC (https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/...)\n\nSo as I need that, I decided to write one myself, since extending the one that provided XML would've been a waste of time, since it is NOT documented and for some reason depends on about 4 packages (also developed by the same maintainer), why the whining you ask, eh? Well fuck this shit. It took me 2(+2 classes) to achieve everything (according to standard as far as I can tell) + went with using a \"hydrator\" as opposed to reflection (the lib used reflection and didn't care too much for the access modified on the property of the object being serialized) so got a pretty solid performance boost, cleaner and simple code (I wrote it for a few hours and it is ugly, but hey KISS and it works perfectly)...\n\nSo with the more ranty part of this rant... Why the fuck so many people don't write independant packages for the simple parts... I don't hate it when I need a package and end up downloading half of the codebase of symfony or whatever fancy framework the dev decided to use, wasn't it the point of having 'package managers' (composer, npm, etc.. you get the deal..) instead of promote our projects and not force others to use our favorite framework that is absolutely out of scope for their projects... \n\nFuck you, fuck me and fuck everybody... If this continues I will continue writing my own packages from scratch, because \"you\" asshole are too lazy to learn and apply SOLID and common sense; even if your life depends on it you cannot write a meaningful piece of code without \"the fancy framework of the month\" holding your hand and allowing you to continue being a dumbass that has enough brain cells to walk straight and remember that you have to go to the toilet and not shit all over the place....\n\nFML....

Of course I can throw a templated unoriginal wordpress site together in a few hours 2 days latest, so I offer that option as a sidenote on the bid, charging almost 2x more. For some reason I dont understand they choose the wp shitshow. I explain all the reasons that not the way to go( which I wont list, if u dont know, u never used it. google up) but they dont care abt the details, they rather pay more for shit job. OFC I reluctantly deliver what they want, but as a result my portfolio is full of unoriginal shit Im not happy showing off. I have a few sites Ive done on the side my prefered way, but they not deployed and sit in my github for all intents n purposes unviewable to potential clients.\nI want to be proud of my portfolio, and it to be a representation of what Im capable of.
