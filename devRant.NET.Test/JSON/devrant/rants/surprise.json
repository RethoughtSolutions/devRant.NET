{"success":true,"rant":{"id":429320,"text":"I am a developer for almost 12 years (I am 24 now, I started early), but all my life I've been a lone wolf. I didn't share code, I didn't had to do peer reviews. The only opportunity that I had to do this in a company, it was completely messed up experience and I ended up being the only developer over there, so there was no one to see or review what I was doing.\n\nSo I basically grew up my entire life working by myself with no supervision.\n\nIt made me a very possessive person about my code and besides knowing that I am a highly above average developer, I can't show it to others because I think they might not really like what they'll see.\n\nThe thing is, this is a very stupid conclusion. If they have something to tell me, it means that there's something to learn, to evolve. After months of struggle, last year I've finally open sourced a project -- which in the time was my greatest thing of all time, so imagine how hard was that for me.\n\nThe reception was pretty good and even one of Meteor's maintainers gave me a star. Since then, I've been slowly opening the source of some legacy projects that would usually go straight to the trash bin.\n\nSo that's the moral of the story people: Don't be shy of your work, make code reviews, learn with other people about your weaknesses -- you'll never know them by yourself.","score":69,"created_time":1487112506,"attached_image":"","num_comments":4,"tags":["code review","code sharing"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"user_id":17237,"user_username":"vinerz","user_score":2747,"user_avatar":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-17_c-3_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-2_16-17_3-14_8-2_7-2_5-2_12-2_17-2_6-14_2-49_15-14_11-4_18-3_4-2_19-3_20-9_21-2.jpg"}}}
